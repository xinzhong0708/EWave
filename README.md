# EWave

EWave Program CAGEO 2018. Zhong and Frehner

The code includes EWave.exe software which is a complied MATLAB GUI code that can be executed alone. 

Please install MATLAB runtime 9.2 and Microsoft Office (Excel) to run this software. (MATLAB runtime can be found: https://se.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). The code is compiled in Windows 10, 64bits system, it is recommended to use the same windows system.

Files include:

Data.xlsx file is the data template of Finero peridotite sample. The user is recommended to check the format and import data accordingly.

Template.xlsx file is an empty excel file where the user can fill in to run their own sample. The only difference compared to the previous one is that this file has no data.

EWave_Exe.zip contains the source code and can be executed alone in MATLAB editor. In case the user wants to edit the code for multi-thread computation or in MATLAB script instead of GUI, this source code can be taken.

In case there is any problem running the software or bug report, please feel free to contact: xinzhong0708@gmail.com. I am happy to assist.
